                    Taming Thymeleaf will teach you about writing web applications with <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a> in no-time.
                    This book teaches you step-by-step how to get started with those technologies and build a fully fledged web application
                    including security, validation, internationalization, testing and more.
                </p>
                <p>Thymeleaf is an amazing technology for building server-side HTML using the Java eco-system.
                    Combined with Spring Boot, it is really a killer combo for a productive development environment.
                    Learn how to structure your code so your application can evolve for years to come.
                    As HTML will always be there, you can do this without having to re-write your frontend every six months
                    for the latest JavaScript framework.</p>

        <p>Wim's Taming Thymeleaf book is a must-read for everyone using Thymeleaf together with Spring Boot.</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed building the nice-looking and feature-rich sample application while reading the book. Along the way, you'll learn how to master internationalization, security, entity updates, error handling, validation, and much more.</p>
        <p>On top of this, Wim reveals so many hidden gems of Spring's excellent Thymeleaf integration that your productivity with this tech stack will significantly increase.</p>
        <p>In the end, you'll have a blueprint for a state-of-the-art Thymeleaf and Spring Boot application. I'm actively using it as my go-to reference whenever I try to solve X with Thymeleaf and Spring Boot. You won't find such great explanations and examples on Stack Overflow.</p>

        <p>The book is a comprehensive guide on how to write large, maintainable web applications with spring boot, Thymeleaf, tailwind css and minimal javascript with alpine.js.</p>
        <p>Starting out simple the author shows how to structure your code and shows common pitfalls. You learn how to test your application from back to front with unit- integration and end-2-end tests.</p>
        <p>If you are already familiar with Thymeleaf you will learn a lot of tricks on how to build reusable, self-contained components and common layouts such that adding new pages and functions are a breeze. You will be surprised how much is possible with "just" HTML, css and a tiny bit of javascript when necessary.</p>
