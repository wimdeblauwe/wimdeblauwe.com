                    Imagine creating dynamic, interactive web applications with minimal JavaScript.
                    That’s the revolutionary promise of <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, a technology that
                    redefines frontend development.
                    This book is your gateway to mastering htmx alongside Java, <a
                        href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a>, transforming the way you build web
                    interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book starts with the basic steps of using htmx, starting from the basic techniques
                    of DOM element swapping through various triggers. It progressively delves into more complex topics,
                    such as responding to htmx requests in the Spring Boot controller and implementing comprehensive UI
                    patterns like lazy loading, active search, and endless scrolling.
                    Further, the book dives into the integration of web components and JavaScript frameworks with htmx
                    to amplify client-side interactivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the book, two projects put all these ideas together.
                    These projects help you see how everything you've learned works in real web applications.

        <p>I could not be more excited about Wim's book, <i>Modern frontends with htmx</i>. It gives Java developers the
            tools to work effectively with htmx as a front end library, with an in-depth treatment of all of the major
            features of htmx and, more importantly, practical examples of how they can be used in conjunction with
            Spring and Thymeleaf. </p>
        <p>Htmx can be a very effective way to build modern web applications, but it is useless
            without similarly effective server-side tools. In this book Wim shows you not only how to use htmx, but how
            to use htmx <i>effectively</i> with Spring and Thymeleaf. This "completes the circle" of modern web
            development
            with htmx and Java, and unlocks the promise of dynamic and modern web applications that don't break the
            complexity bank for Java developers. Thank you Wim!</p>

    <p><i>Modern frontends with htmx</i> is an essential guide for developers eager to integrate htmx
      into their Java-centric projects. This book skillfully bridges htmx with staples —Spring Boot,
      Thymeleaf, and TailwindCSS— presenting a formidable stack for modern web development.</p>
    <p>His methodical approach not only clarifies htmx's utility but also elegantly sidesteps the
      all-too-common pattern of creating overly complex JavaScript SPA frontends, each redundantly
      paired with a mini backend. This book is packed with relevant real-world examples for
      leveraging htmx effectively.</p>

        <p>After <i>Taming Thymeleaf</i> and <i>Practical Guide to building an API backend with Spring Boot</i> Wim has
            produced
            another invaluable resource when it comes to learning htmx. The book touches upon all the important parts
            and showcases the capabilities of htmx.</p>
        <p>Whether you've never used htmx or have already used it extensively, you are sure to find some gems that you
            didn't yet know about. Htmx is, in my opinion, a library that should be seriously considered when building
            web applications, especially when you combine it with AlpineJS or hyperscript. This book further strengthens
            that belief.</p>
