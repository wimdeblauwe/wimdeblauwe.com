                    Imagine creating dynamic, interactive web applications with minimal JavaScript.
                    Thatâ€™s the revolutionary promise of <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, a technology that
                    redefines frontend development.
                    This book is your gateway to mastering htmx alongside Java, <a
                        href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a>, transforming the way you build web
                    interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book starts with the basic steps of using htmx, starting from the basic techniques
                    of DOM element swapping through various triggers. It progressively delves into more complex topics,
                    such as responding to htmx requests in the Spring Boot controller and implementing comprehensive UI
                    patterns like lazy loading, active search, and endless scrolling.
                    Further, the book dives into the integration of web components and JavaScript frameworks with htmx
                    to amplify client-side interactivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the book, two projects put all these ideas together.
                    These projects help you see how everything you've learned works in real web applications.

        <p>I personally wanted to thank you for your book <i>Taming Thymeleaf</i> which I bought on Amazon this week.
            You are an excellent author and I believe that through your book I will move forward perfectly with
            Thymeleaf which I have been enjoying for a while.</p>
        <p>Once again thank you for this excellent technological gift. Keep writing more about Java.</p>

        <p>I've been using Taming Thymeleaf for the past year or so, and it's been a game-changer.
            Not only has it helped me grow my career, but it's also made me a more productive developer by using it as
            my go-to, even before StackOverflow.
            And in the tech world we know that says a lot!</p>
        <p>What Wim shows us is the beauty of working with such light frameworks making Thymeleaf, Tailwind, and Alpine
            js come together just perfect.
            He explains it very well which in turn makes it so easy to learn.</p>
        <p>As someone who spends most of their time writing code, this is huge for me!
            And if you're interested in learning spring-boot with thymeleaf this is a must-have. Thank you for this
            book!</p>

        <p>Wim's Taming Thymeleaf book is a must-read for everyone using Thymeleaf together with Spring Boot.</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed building the nice-looking and feature-rich sample application while reading the book. Along
            the way, you'll learn how to master internationalization, security, entity updates, error handling,
            validation, and much more.</p>
        <p>On top of this, Wim reveals so many hidden gems of Spring's excellent Thymeleaf integration that your
            productivity with this tech stack will significantly increase.</p>
        <p>In the end, you'll have a blueprint for a state-of-the-art Thymeleaf and Spring Boot application. I'm
            actively using it as my go-to reference whenever I try to solve X with Thymeleaf and Spring Boot. You won't
            find such great explanations and examples on Stack Overflow.</p>

        <p>The book is a comprehensive guide on how to write large, maintainable web applications with spring boot,
            Thymeleaf, tailwind css and minimal javascript with alpine.js.</p>
        <p>Starting out simple the author shows how to structure your code and shows common pitfalls. You learn how to
            test your application from back to front with unit- integration and end-2-end tests.</p>
        <p>If you are already familiar with Thymeleaf you will learn a lot of tricks on how to build reusable,
            self-contained components and common layouts such that adding new pages and functions are a breeze. You will
            be surprised how much is possible with "just" HTML, css and a tiny bit of javascript when necessary.</p>

        <p>Great writing - even form validation was engaging. Excellent chapter structure and size and (imho) solid
            combination of technologies. I wish I had it when starting with Spring Boot, alone for the smooth
            introduction of Spring Security, Testcontainers and Spring Data.</p>
        <p>It also offers quite a lot of knowledge bits one picks up with time, like using value classes for IDs, in a
            very well-rounded package. To put it short: A lot of value for the money! ðŸ™Œ</p>

            compact and with really helpful code examples. The book helped me tremendously to set up and design a new
            Spring Boot & Thymeleaf project after a long break from the Java world.</p>
