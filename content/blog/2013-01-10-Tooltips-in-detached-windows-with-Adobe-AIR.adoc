I just had an issue where we display a tooltip on a custom component in Flex. This worked fine until we also used this component in a http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=WorkingWithWindows_1.html[detached window in Adobe AIR]. We never saw the tooltip in the detached window.

This is the code we used before in the custom component:

[source]
----m_tooltip = ToolTipManager.createToolTip( tooltip, event.stageX + 10, event.stageY + 10 );[/code]

This is what fixed it:

[source]
----m_tooltip = ToolTipManager.createToolTip( tooltip, event.stageX + 10, event.stageY + 10, null, this );[/code]

The important part is the `this` parameter passed into the createToolTip method. If not passed into the method, the framework will always use the `FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication`, which is not your detached window. By passing in the reference to custom component to the tooltip manager, it will use the correct native window to display the tooltip in.
