This blog post will explain how I currently write Spring Boot applications.
I have been writing Java for over 25 years, and most of that involved Spring and its ecosystem.
I will talk about how I architect my app, package structure, naming conventions, etc.

====

== Getting started

A new project gets started in 2 possible ways:

* https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr]: When I am building a REST API application, I use https://start.spring.io to generate the project.
* https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/ttcli[ttcli]: For projects using server-side rendering with Thymeleaf, I use the command line tool I purposely built for starting that type of projects.

== High-level architecture

The architecture leans heavily on the Domain Driven Design concept of the _Aggregate Root_.

An _Aggregate_ is the collection of domain entities that together form a consistent whole.
The entity inside the aggregate that is to be considered the most important entity is called the aggregate root.

A simple example is an `Order` with `List<OrderEntry>`.
The aggregate entails the 2 entities: `Order` and `OrderEntry`.
The `Order` would be the aggregate root.

If we apply this to the well-known https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic[Petclinic] example, we see the following entities:

* Owner
* Pet
* Visit
* Veterinarian
* Speciality

Three of these entities are clearly aggregate roots: Owner, Visit and Veterinarian.

An Owner can exist independently and would typically be the entry point for managing pet ownership.
A Veterinarian should also be an aggregate root.
Veterinarians exist independently in the business domain and have their own lifecycle.
They can practice multiple specialties and see many pets, but they're not owned by or dependent on other entities.
Visit is likely an aggregate root as well.
While a Visit involves an Owner, a Pet and a Veterinarian, it represents a distinct business transaction with its own lifecycle, business rules, and consistency requirements (scheduling, billing, medical records, etc.).

For the Pet entity, things are less clear.
We can consider a Pet to be a separate aggregate root or part of the Owner aggregate.
Remember:

[quote,George Box]
“All models are wrong, some are useful.”

If we want to model that the Pet exists on its own, as an animal without being a Pet, we can consider the Pet an aggregate root.
However, an animal is only a Pet when considered as such by an owner.
For that reason, I would consider Pet to be part of the Owner aggregate.

We will also consider Speciality to be an entity within the Veterinarian aggregate.

This class diagram shows an overview:

Why do we need to know this?

Because it defines how I build my packages.

== Package structure

I name my packages based on the aggregate roots of the application.

In our example, this would be:

[source]
----
com.company.app
  + owner
  + visit
  + veterinarian
----

Inside each of those packages, I place all entities of the aggregate and also any value objects that those entities use.

For example, in `com.company.app.owner`, I would have the following classes:

[source]
----
com.company.app.owner
  + OwnerId
  + Owner
  + PetId
  + Pet
  + Mass
----

`Owner` and `Pet` are entities, while `OwnerId`, `PetId`, and `Mass` are value objects. `OwnerId` and `PetId` encapsulate a `UUID` which is used as primary key in the database. `Mass` represents the pet's weight and encapsulates either a `double` or `int`, depending on how we want to model it.

Value objects like `Mass` eliminate the guesswork around units.
Without them, you're left wondering "what unit did we choose for the pet's mass?" when you see a simple `double mass` property.
The alternative is awkward naming like `double massInKg` or `double massInGrams`.

The code for the `Mass` class could look something like this:

[source,java]
----
public record Mass(int value) {
  public Mass {
    Assert.isTrue( value > 0, "The Mass value should be a positive number" );
  }

  public static Mass ofGrams(int value) {
    return new Mass(value);
  }

  public static Mass ofKg(double value) {
    return new Mass((int)(value * 1000));
  }
}
----

Another advantage of the `Mass` value object is guaranteed validity.
You know the mass is already valid (for example, not a negative number) because the value object validates this during construction.

For each of those packages, I add the following sub-packages: `repository`, `usecase`, and `web`.

[source]
----
com.company.app.owner
  * repository
  * usecase
  * web
  + OwnerId
  + Owner
  + PetId
  + Pet
----

Any of those sub-packages can use the domain classes, but the domain classes cannot use any of the classes from the subpackages.

The `repository` package has all classes related to database interaction.
It will either use the domain classes directly when using JPA, or there will be dedicated entity objects inside the `repository` package in case you want to do a mapping.
If you don't use JPA, but `JdbcClient` for example, then the domain objects can remain "pure" and you put all JDBC-related code inside that package.

The `usecase` package contains what is tradionally considered the _service layer_.
But instead of one big service class, I like to split things up into smaller, focused classes.

Finally, the `web` package will contain the controller and the _Data Transfer Objects_ (DTO) for the JSON serialization and deserialization.

[NOTE]
====
There is no Kafka or message queue in the example.
If there would be, I would probably add another sub-package called `messaging` where I would place the message listeners.
====

== Production code

=== Repository implementation

If this is an application where I have full control over the database, I will usually put JPA annotations on the domain objects.
If you don't want to do this and keep your domain "pure", then you can create extra JPA specific objects (e.g. `OwnerEntity`, `PetEntity`) in the `repository` package.
See https://reflectoring.io/book/[Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture] for more information on the various ways that you can do mapping between application layers.

In our Owner example, this would like as follows:

[source,java]
----
package com.company.app.owner.repository;

import io.github.wimdeblauwe.jpearl.AbstractEntity;
import jakarta.persistence.CascadeType;
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.OneToMany;
import java.util.HashSet;

@Entity
public class Owner extends AbstractEntity<OwnerId> {

  private String name;

  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "category", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
  private Set<Pet> pets = new HashSet<>();

  protected Owner() {}

  public Owner(OwnerId id, String name, Set<Pet> pets) {
    super(id);
    this.name = name;
    for(Pet pet : pets) {
      addPet(pet);
    }
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public void addPet(Pet pet) {
    pet.setOwner(this);
    pets.add(pet);
  }
}
----

With `OwnerId` defined as:

[source,java]
----
package com.company.app.owner.repository;

import io.github.wimdeblauwe.jpearl.AbstractEntityId;

import java.util.UUID;

public class OwnerId extends AbstractEntityId<UUID> {

  protected OwnerId() {
  }

  public OwnerId(UUID id) {
    super(id);
  }
}
----

The classes use the https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/jpearl[JPearl] library which makes it easy to work with value objects for the primary keys (e.g. `OwnerId`).
The library also assumes that the primary key is passed into the constructor so you never have an object that is different depending on whether it has been saved in the database.
It makes it easier to use the object as a domain object if you are not using it as a JPA entity, and it makes the equals and hashcode implementations trivial.

The `AbstractEntity` class defines `equals()` and `hashCode()` by comparing the `id` only which is the correct way for an entity.
If you need to implement equals and hashcode yourself on your JPA entities, be sure to read https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-implement-equals-and-hashcode-using-the-jpa-entity-identifier/[How to implement equals and hashCode using the JPA entity identifier] and https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-implement-equals-hashcode-and-tostring-with-jpa-and-hibernate/[The best way to implement equals, hashCode, and toString with JPA and Hibernate].

Because `Pet` is considered to be part of the `Owner` aggregate root, we can use the `@OneToMany` JPA annotation to map the full `Pet` objects from the `Owner`.
If we have references between aggregate roots, then we should link by id only!
As an example, this is how the `Visit` aggregate root could look like:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Visit extends AbstractEntity<VisitId> {

  private VeterinarianId veterinarianId;

  private OwnerId ownerId;

  private PetId petId;

  private Instant appointmentTime;

  protected Visit() {
  }

  public Visit(VisitId id,
               VeterinarianId veterinarianId,
               OwnerId ownerId,
               PetId petId,
               Instant appointmentTime) {
    super(id);
    this.veterinarianId = veterinarianId;
    this.ownerId = ownerId;
    this.petId = petId;
    this.appointmentTime = appointmentTime;
  }

  // ....
}
----

There are several advantages to this:

* The JPA mapping is simpler.
You don't need to think about `@OneToMany` or `@ManyToMany`, do you use unidirectional or bidirectional mapping, etc...
* You avoid queries would get a large amount of data that maybe you don't need.
In this example, if we mapped the complete `Owner`, we would retrieve all its `Pet` instances as well while we are only interested in the `Pet` that is part of the visit.
* Less chance of competing updates.
If you update a Veterinarian while simultaneously updating their visits, you won't accidentally overwrite the Veterinarian changes with stale data from the Visit update.

The only drawback is that you need to do extra database calls in case you want more information from the entities that are referenced by id only.
This drawback can be mitigated by using https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/repositories/projections.html[projections] for example, to retrieve the id and the name if that makes sense for the use case.

Now, inside each `repository` package, I create the following structure:

[source]
----
com.company.app.owner.repository
+ OwnerRepository
+ JpaOwnerRepository
+ SpringDataJpaOwnerRepository
----

This three-layer approach separates concerns cleanly: the public interface `OwnerRepository` defines what operations are available, the implementation handles the business logic of those operations, and the Spring Data interface provides the actual database interactions.
This separation makes the code more testable and allows you to swap persistence technologies without affecting the rest of your application.

[NOTE]
.Only aggregate roots get repositories
====
Because `Pet` is an entity within the `Owner` aggregate, we don't create a `PetRepository`.
All database interactions for Pets will be done via the `OwnerRepository`.
====

The `OwnerRepository` is the most important interface.
It is the public part, while the other two should be considered implementation details.

[source,java]
----
package com.company.app.owner.repository;

public interface OwnerRepository {
  OwnerId nextId();

  PetId nextPetId();

  void save(Owner owner);

  Optional<Owner> findById(OwnerId id);

  Owner getById(OwnerId id);

  Page<Owner> findAll(Pageable pageable);
}
----

By defining our repository like this, we hide the fact that we use Spring Data JPA.
This has two advantages:

* We can freely change our persistence technology.
Suppose we want to use JDBC instead of Spring Data JPA.
We can just add a different implementation in the `repository` package and the rest of the code base would not be affected.
* We can write an in memory version of the repository which will be very convenient to write tests for our use cases.
If we directly would do `OwnerRepository extends CrudRepository<Owner, OwnerId>`, then we need to implement more methods than we would like to given all the methods that `CrudRepository` has.

What you might not recognize are the `nextId` and `nextPetId` methods.
They allow getting a primary key from the repository.
If the `OwnerId` for example is using a `UUID` internally, then this is not really needed, but it allows to be ready in case we change our minds.
We might want to use a `Long` taken from a database sequence, or use a https://vladmihalcea.com/uuid-database-primary-key/[Time-sorted Identifier] for better performance.
By getting the id from the repository, these kind of changes are fairly easy to implement.

[NOTE]
====
If you don't want to use early primary key generation, but more traditional ways of having the database set the primary key on save, you can still use this architecture.
You just don't have those `nextId()` methods on your repository in that case.
====

One last thing about my repository interface is that I usually have `findBy...` methods that return `Optional` and also `getBy..` methods that will throw an exception when not found.
It avoids having these duplicate `orElseThrow(...)` statements in my use cases.

The `JpaOwnerRepository` contains the implementation of the `OwnerRepository` interface:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.UUID;

@Repository
class JpaOwnerRepository implements OwnerRepository {

  private final SpringDataJpaOwnerRepository repository;

  public JpaOwnerRepository(SpringDataJpaOwnerRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  @Override
  public OwnerId nextId() {
    return new OwnerId(UUID.randomUUID());
  }

  @Override
  public PetId nextPetId() {
    return new PetId(UUID.randomUUID());
  }

  @Override
  void save(Owner owner) {
    repository.save(owner);
  }

  @Override
  Optional<Owner> findById(OwnerId id) {
    return repository.findById(id);
  }

  @Override
  Owner getById(OwnerId id) {
    return repository.findById(id)
      .orElseThrow(new OwnerNotFoundException(id));
  }

  @Override
  Page<Owner> findAll(Pageable pageable) {
    return repository.findAll(pageable);
  }
}
----

As you can see, the heavy lifting is delegated to the `SpringDataJpaOwnerRepository` which looks like this:

[source,java]
----
interface SpringDataJpaOwnerRepository extends CrudRepository<Owner, OwnerId>, PagingAndSortingRepository<Owner, OwnerId> {

}
----

Let's move up to the next layer: use cases.

=== Use cases

Using use cases instead of a single service class is a concept coming from https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html[Clean Architecture].

For a simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete[CRUD] application, these would be something like:

* `CreateOwner`
* `UpdateOwner`
* `GetOwner`
* `DeleteOwner`

We can get a bit more creative and use something like `RegisterOwner` or `RegisterOwnerWithPet` or `RegisterPetToExistingOwner`, but the basic idea is the same: the use case class does one action (as seen from the user's point-of-view).

They have a single method `execute`.
This method can be `void`, or return something.
It can also have no parameters, or it can have a few.

As an example, this is the `RegisterOwnerWithPet` use case:

[source,java]
----
package com.company.app.owner.usecase;

@UseCase
public class RegisterOwnerWithPet {

  private final OwnerRepository repository;

  public RegisterOwnerWithPet(OwnerRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  public Owner execute(RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters parameters) {
    OwnerId id = repository.nextId();
    Owner owner = new Owner(id, parameters.ownerName());

    PetId id = repository.nextPetId();
    Pet pet = new Pet(id, parameters.petName(), parameters.petWeight());

    owner.addPet(pet);

    repository.save(owner);

    return owner;
  }
}
----

The `@UseCase` annotation is a custom annotation that combines `@Component` with `@Transactional`:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.core.annotation.AliasFor;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Component
@Transactional
public @interface UseCase {

  @AliasFor(annotation = Transactional.class, attribute = "readOnly")
  boolean readOnly() default false;
}
----

The `RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters` is a record that has already validated all parts that it contains.
It is part of the domain and should use domain objects and/or value objects when possible.
The nice thing about this is that a use case does not need to worry if there are things in the parameters that are not valid.
Like being `null` if they should not.
When we get to the web layer, we will see how we do the validation there and convert to such a parameters object.

[NOTE]
.Command
====
I have seen people use `...Command` classes for what I call the parameters (See https://medium.com/@roshikanayanadhara/clean-architecture-in-net-a-practical-guide-with-examples-817568b3f42e[Clean Architecture in .NET: A Practical Guide with Examples] for an example).
I find command confusing as a command seems like something that does something, which is not the case.
Calling the set of parameters `...Parameters` makes more sense to me.
====

This is the code of the `RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters` record:

[source,java]
----
record RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters(
    String ownerName,
    String petName,
    Mass petWeight) {
  RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters {
    Assert.hasText(ownerName, "The RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters ownerName should have text");
    Assert.hasText(petName, "The RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters petName should have text");
    Assert.notNull(petWeight, "The RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters petWeight should not be null");
  }
}
----

Using Spring's `Assert` methods, we fail quickly in case the parts that make up the parameters are invalid.

[NOTE]
====
One thing that comes up frequently when working with use cases is "Can/Should a use case call other use cases?".
As a rule of thumb, I try to avoid this.
This keeps use cases focused on a single responsibility and makes them easier to test independently.
When there's common code, I extract it into helper components instead.

For example, suppose you have an application that displays sports scores.
You might have use cases like `GetScoreForGame` and `GetScoresForTeamInSeason`.
You might be tempted to call the `GetScoreForGame` use case from within `GetScoresForTeamInSeason`, but it's better to extract a `ScoreCalculator` helper component that both use cases can depend on.

Another drawback of having use cases call other use cases is potential performance issues. If a use case queries the database for a single record and you reuse it to fetch many records, you'll end up with an inefficient database access pattern. Using a dedicated query to retrieve all the information you need in one go can massively improve the use case's performance.
====

Now we can again go up to the next layer: the web layer.

=== Controllers on the web layer

Inside the `web` sub-package, I will put the `RestController` (or `Controller` for a Thymeleaf project) and any DTOs that are required.
I do like a DTO as a construct, but I really don't like putting it in the name of a class as a suffix.
You also don't use `OwnerRepositoryInterface` or `OwnerClass` as names.

Instead, I use `...Request` for DTOs that are used as request bodies and `...Reponse` for those that are used as response bodies.
Keeping up with our "register owner with pet" example, the REST controller would be something like this:

[source,java]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/owners")
public class OwnerController {
  private final RegisterOwnerWithPet registerOwnerWithPet;
  // There would be more use cases here

  public OwnerController(RegisterOwnerWithPet registerOwnerWithPet) {
    this.registerOwnerWithPet = registerOwnerWithPet;
  }

  @PostMapping
  public OwnerResponse registerOwnerWithPet(@Valid @RequestBody RegisterOwnerWithPetRequest request) {

    RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters parameters = request.toParameters();
    Owner owner = registerOwnerWithPet.execute(parameters);

    return OwnerResponse.of(owner);
  }

  // More controller methods here
}
----

The `RegisterOwnerWithPetRequest` looks quite similar to `RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters`:

[source,java]
----
record RegisterOwnerWithPetRequest(
    @NotBlank String ownerName,
    @NotBlank String petName,
    @Positive int petWeight) {

  RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters toParameters() {
    return new RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters(
        ownerName,
        petName,
        Mass.ofGrams(petWeight));
  }
}
----

The main difference is that we use validation annotations here.
This allows returning a nice error message to the caller in case there are validation issues.

By using my https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/error-handling-spring-boot-starter[error-handling-spring-boot-starter] library, I just need to add the dependency and I get something like this out of the box:

[source,json]
----
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Validation failed for object='request'. Error count: 2",
  "fieldErrors": [
    {
      "code": "REQUIRED_NOT_BLANK",
      "property": "ownerName",
      "message": "must not be blank",
      "rejectedValue": "",
      "path": "ownerName"
    },
    {
      "code": "REQUIRED_NOT_BLANK",
      "property": "petName",
      "message": "must not be blank",
      "rejectedValue": null,
      "path": "petName"
    }
  ]
}
----

If there are no validation issues, we convert the request into a parameters object and pass it to the use case.
In this example, the conversion to the `RegisterOwnerWithPetParameters` object is trivial, but when more value objects are used, there will be slightly more code involved.
The rule to remember is that parameter objects are defined in terms of the domain and should use all the richness like Value Objects.
The request objects are defined in terms of the JSON they represent.
For that reason, while they look similar, they are two distinct things that warrant to have their own class.

The result of the use case is converted into a response via a static factory method on `OwnerResponse`:

[source,java]
----
record OwnerResponse(UUID id, String ownerName, List<String> petNames) {

  static OwnerResponse of(Owner owner) {
    return new OwnerResponse(
        owner.id().value(),
        owner.name(),
        owner.pets().stream().map(Pet::name).toList()
    );
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Something I see a lot in tutorials and also in real code is the use of a single DTO to be used as a request body for creating _and_ updating something, and also use that as a response object.
This is not a good idea as most of the time, you don't have exactly the same fields used in those 3 cases.
By using `...Response` and `...Request` naming, you avoid this problem as many people will be hesitant to use something called `OwnerResponse` as the request body in the controller.
====

In the `OwnerResponse`, I use basic Java classes which serialize easily.
This usually means unwrapping value objects like calling the `value()` method on `OwnerId()`.

=== Infrastructure code

What about the code that is not relevant to a single aggregate root, but rather is setup to the complete application?
For that code, I always have an `infrastructure` package at the level of the aggregate root packages:

[source]
----
com.company.app
  + infrastructure
  + owner
  + visit
  + veterinarian
----

Some typical layout of the `infrastructure` package would be this:

[source]
----
com.company.app.infrastructure
  + security
    + WebSecurityConfiguration --> Spring Security configuration
  + stereotype
    + UseCase
  + util
    + ObjectUtils --> Some helper methods.
  + web
    + WebMvcConfiguration
----

[TIP]
====
One helper method I like to add to my `ObjectUtils` is something that applies a Function to a possible `null` instance.
The code for this is:

[source,java]
----
  public static @Nullable <A, T> T transformOrNull(@Nullable A obj,
                                                   Function<A, T> transformer) {
    Assert.notNull(transformer, "Transformer cannot be null");

    if (Objects.isNull(obj)) {
      return null;
    }

    return transformer.apply(obj);
  }
----

It allows to use this:

[source,java]
----
String name = transformOrNull(owner, Owner::name);
----

Alternativly, you can use `Optional.ofNullable(owner).map(Owner::name)`, but that just creates a `Optional` for no good reason.
====

== Why Not Hexagonal Architecture?

You might be wondering why I don't use Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters), especially since my approach shares some similarities with its layered structure.

While Hexagonal Architecture is a solid architectural pattern, I find it introduces more ceremony than necessary for most Spring Boot applications.
Here's why I prefer the approach outlined in this post:

* **Reduced Abstraction Overhead**: Hexagonal Architecture requires defining ports (interfaces) for every external dependency - databases, message queues, external APIs, etc.
While this provides maximum flexibility, it often results in interfaces that have only one implementation.
My approach uses abstractions where they add real value (like the repository interface) but doesn't force abstraction everywhere.

* **Simpler Mental Model**: Developers can quickly understand the three-layer structure within each aggregate (domain, use cases, infrastructure concerns).
Hexagonal Architecture's inside-out thinking and port/adapter terminology can be harder for teams to grasp and apply consistently.

* **Less Boilerplate**: You don't need to create adapter classes for every external integration.
Spring's built-in abstractions (like `@Repository`, `@RestController`) serve as sufficient boundaries in most cases.

* **Focused Domain Protection**: My approach still protects the domain layer - domain objects can't depend on infrastructure concerns.
But it does so without the extensive interface definitions that Hexagonal Architecture requires.

That said, if you like Hexagonal Architecture, by all means use it.
But for typical Spring Boot applications, the approach I've outlined provides the right balance of structure and simplicity in my opinion.

For me, it hits the sweet spot between under-architecture (everything in one layer) and over-architecture (too many abstractions) for most Spring Boot projects I've encountered.

== Conclusion

This architectural approach has served me well across numerous Spring Boot projects over the years.
By organizing code around aggregate roots and separating concerns into distinct layers, we achieve several key benefits:

* **Maintainability**: Each aggregate is self-contained with clear boundaries.
Changes to one aggregate rarely affect others, making the codebase easier to modify and extend.

* **Testability**: The separation between domain logic, use cases, and infrastructure allows for focused unit tests.
You can test business logic without databases, and test repositories without web controllers.

* **Flexibility**: The abstraction layers mean you can swap out persistence technologies, change web frameworks, or add new interfaces (like message queues) without major refactoring.

* **Team Productivity**: New team members can quickly understand the structure and contribute to specific aggregates without needing to grasp the entire system.

* **Domain Focus**: By keeping domain objects at the center and pushing technical concerns to the edges, the code better reflects the business domain it serves.

While this approach requires more initial setup than a typical Spring Boot tutorial, the investment pays dividends as your application grows in complexity.
The structure scales well from small applications to large enterprise systems.

I find that this architecture works equally well for CRUD applications as well.
Even simple create, read, update, and delete operations benefit from the clear structure and separation of concerns, making them easier to maintain and extend over time.

The key is to be intentional about your architectural decisions and consistent in their application.
Start with these patterns, adapt them to your specific needs, and don't be afraid to evolve them as you learn what works best for your team and domain.
