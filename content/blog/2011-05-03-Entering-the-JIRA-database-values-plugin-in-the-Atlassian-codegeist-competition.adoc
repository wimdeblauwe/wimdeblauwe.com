I just entered my https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/4969[JIRA Database Values Plugin] in the http://codegeist.atlassian.com/[Atlassian Codegeist] competition. You can view my entry here: http://codegeist.atlassian.com/entry/167349

I uploaded a video with it to make it more visual. I was quite surprised to find it so easy to do on my Ubuntu (just updated to 11.04).

1. Installed http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php[recordMyDesktop] to do the actual screencast recording:
+
`sudo apt-get install gtk-recordmydesktop`
+
This will install a program shortcut called 'Desktop recorder'. Once running, there is a handy systray icon to start and stop the recording.

2. Installed `mencoder` and used this command line to convert the `.ogv` file to xvid:
+
`mencoder out.ogv -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o jdvp.avi`

That is it!

Don't forget to vote for my entry!

PS: Is there anybody who knows a free program running on Ubuntu that allows to add text overlays in the video?
