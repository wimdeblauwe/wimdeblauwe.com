I started my YouTube channel this week.
It was quite something to come to this result, speaking to a camera is quite scary at first, but I think I got a nice result in the end ðŸ™‚

Check out my first video here:

It explains the very basics on how to get started with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

The corresponding code can be viewed on the https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/youtube-example-code/tree/main/spring-boot-thymeleaf[github repo].
